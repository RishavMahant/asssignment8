The features which I believe to have implemented correctly are :

(1) The letter tiles in the player's "hand" are selected randmonly from a data structure with
	the proper distribution of the letters
(2)Letter tiles can be dragged and dropped onto target Scrabble squares
(3)program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto whcih Scrabble square
(4)board includes bonus squares
(5)score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
(6)any number of words can be played until player wishes to quit
(7)the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
(8)After playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the
  player's "hand" back to 7 tiles are selected.
(9)score is kept for multiple words. 
(10)Tiles can only be dragged from the rack to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere 
  else , they will be bounced back to the " rack".
(11)User can always restart the game

Partial implementation:
(1)Once the tile is placed it can be moved based on user to make it more easier for the user
  to access the file
(2)Except for the first letter, all subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or
  below letters with no space. Else, they will bounce back, but they wont bounce back
